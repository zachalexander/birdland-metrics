# 2026 AL East Season Preview: What 10,000 Simulations Tell Us

The 2026 season hasn't started yet, but our model has already played it out 10,000 times. Here's what the numbers say about each AL East team's projected win distribution — and what those distributions reveal about the division race ahead.

For each team below, we've included a win distribution chart generated from our Monte Carlo simulations. The bars represent how frequently each win total appeared across 10,000 simulated seasons. The taller the bar, the more likely that outcome. Think of it as a probability fingerprint for each team's season.

## The Projected Standings

Before diving into each team, here's the top-level view:

| Team | Projected Wins | 80% Range (P10-P90) | Playoff Odds | Division Odds |
|------|---------------|---------------------|-------------|--------------|
| NYY | 97 | 89-105 | 95.5% | 58.8% |
| BOS | 92 | 84-100 | 83.4% | 23.3% |
| TOR | 90 | 82-99 | 73.7% | 14.5% |
| BAL | 84 | 76-92 | 38.9% | 3.4% |
| TB | 71 | 63-79 | 0.7% | 0.0% |

The AL East is a three-tier division in 2026: a frontrunner, a competitive middle class, and a team in full rebuild. Let's break down each team's distribution.

## New York Yankees: The Clear Favorite

**Projected wins: 97 | Playoff odds: 95.5% | Win AL East: 58.8%**

<!-- visualization: win-distribution, {"teams": ["NYY"], "title": "Yankees Projected Win Distribution"} -->

The Yankees enter 2026 with the highest ELO rating in the division at 1634 — a reflection of sustained dominance across 2024 and 2025. Their distribution is centered firmly in the mid-to-upper 90s, with the model projecting 97 wins at the median.

What stands out isn't just the median — it's the floor. Even in the Yankees' worst-case scenarios (10th percentile), they're still winning 89 games. That's a borderline playoff team even in a bad year. In their best-case scenarios, they're pushing toward 105 wins and one of the best records in baseball.

The 58.8% division title probability reflects genuine uncertainty — the AL East is strong enough that winning 95+ games doesn't guarantee a division crown — but the Yankees are the only team in this division that the model gives better-than-even odds to finish first.

### Why the model is so high on New York

ELO is a cumulative system. The Yankees didn't just have one good season — they've been compounding ELO gains across multiple years. Even after a negative preseason WAR adjustment of -41.9 points (reflecting offseason roster losses of -7.6 net WAR), their rating remained the highest in the division. Sustained winning creates a reservoir of ELO that's hard to drain in a single offseason.

## Boston Red Sox: The Overlooked Contender

**Projected wins: 92 | Playoff odds: 83.4% | Win AL East: 23.3%**

<!-- visualization: win-distribution, {"teams": ["BOS"], "title": "Red Sox Projected Win Distribution"} -->

Boston's distribution tells the story of a team that's squarely in contention but faces a real ceiling. Their median of 92 wins would be an excellent season by any historical standard, yet it still might not be enough to win this division.

The Red Sox have an 83.4% chance of making the playoffs — strong, but notice that 60.1% of that comes through the wild card rather than winning the division (23.3%). The model sees Boston as more likely to be a wild card team than a division champion. That's not a knock — it's a reflection of how good the Yankees are projected to be.

Boston's 80% range stretches from 84 to 100 wins. At the high end of their distribution, they're a legitimate 100-win team capable of running away with the division. At the low end, they're still a competitive .500+ club. There's very little downside risk here.

### The offseason factor

The Red Sox absorbed a modest -3.9 net WAR in offseason roster changes, translating to a -21.5 ELO point adjustment. That's manageable for a team coming off a strong 2025 campaign. Their end-of-season ELO of 1622 dropped to 1601 after the adjustment — still firmly in the upper tier of the league.

## Toronto Blue Jays: The World Series Hangover Question

**Projected wins: 90 | Playoff odds: 73.7% | Win AL East: 14.5%**

<!-- visualization: win-distribution, {"teams": ["TOR"], "title": "Blue Jays Projected Win Distribution"} -->

Toronto made the 2025 World Series. So why does the model project them third in the division?

The answer lies in ELO's memory. The Blue Jays' 2025 surge was the biggest in the division — they gained 149 ELO points, more than any other AL East team. But they started 2025 from a deep hole: an end-of-2024 rating of just 1466, the lowest in the division after a disappointing 2024 campaign. One great year dramatically improved their rating, but it couldn't fully erase the prior baseline.

Their distribution is centered at 90 wins with an 80% range of 82 to 99 — nearly identical in shape to Boston's, just shifted 2 wins lower. That 2-win gap is the residual effect of Toronto's weaker 2024 baseline still influencing the multi-year rating.

The 73.7% playoff probability is nothing to dismiss. Toronto is a legitimate contender. But the model wants to see sustained performance before elevating them above teams that have been consistently strong for longer. If the Blue Jays come out hot in April and May, the ELO system will respond — ratings update after every game, and a strong first half would rapidly close the gap with Boston and narrow the distance to New York.

### The convergence play

Toronto's offseason WAR adjustment was -4.1 (translating to -22.5 ELO points), similar in magnitude to Boston's. Both teams enter 2026 with slightly weakened rosters compared to their 2025 versions, but the core talent that fueled a World Series run is still in place.

## Baltimore Orioles: The Upside Is Real

**Projected wins: 84 | Playoff odds: 38.9% | Win AL East: 3.4%**

<!-- visualization: win-distribution, {"teams": ["BAL"], "title": "Orioles Projected Win Distribution"} -->

This is the distribution that Orioles fans should study carefully — not for the median, but for the shape.

At 84 projected wins, Baltimore sits in the division's middle tier with a 38.9% chance of reaching the playoffs. That's below a coinflip, and the 3.4% division title probability is essentially a long shot. But distributions tell a richer story than point estimates.

Look at the right tail. The Orioles' 75th percentile is 89 wins. Their 90th percentile is 92. In roughly one out of every four simulated seasons, Baltimore wins 89 or more games — which, in most years, is enough for a playoff spot. In one out of ten simulations, they're a 92-win team competing for the division.

The left tail is concerning: a 10th percentile of 76 wins represents a genuinely bad season. The Orioles' range is wide because the model is uncertain about them — a team with a mediocre 2025 record but significant offseason additions is inherently harder to project.

### The offseason swing

Baltimore was the only AL East team with a positive preseason WAR adjustment. The Orioles added a net +7.3 WAR through offseason transactions, translating to a +40.2 ELO point boost — the largest positive adjustment in the entire division. That moved their rating from 1510 to 1551, a meaningful jump that the model credits.

But the starting point matters. A disappointing 2025 left Baltimore's base ELO well below the division's top three. The offseason additions narrowed the gap but didn't close it. The model is essentially saying: this team got significantly better on paper, but we need to see it on the field before projecting a playoff run with confidence.

### Why this could be wrong

ELO's biggest blind spot with the Orioles is player development. If young players take a step forward — the kind of improvement that player-level projection systems capture through aging curves — the model won't see it until the wins show up in the standings. A breakout from a key young arm or bat would push Baltimore toward the upper end of their distribution faster than the model currently expects.

## Tampa Bay Rays: The Rebuild Year

**Projected wins: 71 | Playoff odds: 0.7% | Win AL East: 0.0%**

<!-- visualization: win-distribution, {"teams": ["TB"], "title": "Rays Projected Win Distribution"} -->

Tampa Bay's distribution is the starkest in the division — a bell curve centered firmly in the low 70s, with virtually no path to the playoffs.

The Rays enter 2026 with the division's lowest ELO at 1468, reflecting a sub-.500 2025 season compounded by a negative preseason WAR adjustment of -4.7 (a -25.7 ELO point hit from roster losses). Their 80% range of 63 to 79 wins means the model sees Tampa Bay as a 65-to-80 win team in the vast majority of outcomes.

The 0.7% playoff probability isn't zero, but it's close enough to suggest this is a rebuilding year in the model's eyes. Even Tampa Bay's best-case scenarios (90th percentile: 79 wins) fall short of what's typically needed for an AL wild card spot.

### The Rays caveat

If any franchise has earned the benefit of the doubt when it comes to defying projections, it's Tampa Bay. The Rays have a track record of outperforming their on-paper talent through development, analytics-driven strategy, and creative roster management. ELO can't capture that institutional edge — it only sees results. If the Rays find another crop of undervalued arms and surprise contributors, they could outperform this projection. But the model has to go with what it can measure, and right now, the numbers point to a long season in St. Petersburg.

## The Division Race: Three Scenarios

What does the model see when it looks at the full range of outcomes?

### Scenario 1: Yankees Cruise (Most Likely — ~45% of simulations)
The Yankees win 95+ games and claim the division comfortably. Boston and Toronto battle for wild card spots. Baltimore hovers around .500. Tampa Bay finishes last. This is the modal outcome — not exciting, but it's what the numbers say is most likely.

### Scenario 2: Three-Team Race (~30% of simulations)
The Yankees, Red Sox, and Blue Jays all finish within 5 games of each other. This happens when New York underperforms their median (they fall to 92-93 wins) while Boston or Toronto hits their upside (95+ wins). In this scenario, the division isn't decided until September, and all three teams are jockeying for playoff positioning.

### Scenario 3: The Orioles Crash the Party (~15% of simulations)
Baltimore's offseason investments pay off immediately. Young players develop. The pitching staff stays healthy. The Orioles push into the high 80s or low 90s and enter the wild card race. This is the scenario where the model's preseason uncertainty works in Baltimore's favor — the wide distribution means upside is real, even if it's not the most likely outcome.

## How to Read These Charts Through the Season

These distributions represent the model's best guess *before a single game is played*. They'll change — rapidly — once the season starts. Here's what to watch for:

**April-May:** The distributions will remain wide. Early-season results shift ELO, but not enough to dramatically narrow the ranges. A 20-10 start by Baltimore wouldn't make them division favorites yet, but it would move the needle.

**June-July:** By mid-season, the model has incorporated ~80 games of 2026 data. The distributions tighten. Teams that are genuinely good will separate from teams that got hot early.

**August-September:** The distributions are narrow, and the projections closely track actual standings. This is when the model is at its most accurate — and when the playoff odds become truly meaningful.

Check back throughout the season as these projections update daily. Every game shifts the ELO ratings, and every shift ripples through 10,000 new simulations.
