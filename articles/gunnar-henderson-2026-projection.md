# Which Gunnar Henderson Shows Up in 2026?

Gunnar Henderson has played 497 major league games. He's been an MVP candidate and he's been merely good. At 24 years old, entering his age-25 season, the question isn't whether Henderson belongs — it's which version of him the Orioles are building around.

The projection systems see a 6.0 fWAR player. That's an All-Star. But the range of outcomes around that number is where the story gets interesting, because Henderson's two full seasons couldn't look more different from each other.

## The Two Seasons

Here's Henderson's career at a glance:

| Season | Age | G | AVG | OBP | SLG | OPS | HR | SB | K% | wRC+ | WAR |
|--------|-----|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|----|----|------|-----|
| 2022 | 21 | 34 | .259 | .348 | .440 | .788 | 4 | 1 | 25.8% | 127 | 0.8 |
| 2023 | 22 | 150 | .255 | .325 | .489 | .814 | 28 | 10 | 25.6% | 122 | 4.7 |
| **2024** | **23** | **159** | **.281** | **.364** | **.529** | **.893** | **37** | **21** | **22.1%** | **154** | **7.9** |
| 2025 | 24 | 154 | .274 | .349 | .438 | .787 | 17 | 30 | 21.0% | 120 | 4.8 |

The 2024 season was a top-5 WAR performance in all of baseball. Henderson hit 37 home runs, stole 21 bases, posted a 154 wRC+, and ranked 8th in the majors in wRC+ among qualified hitters. He was 23 years old. The number that jumps off the page is the .529 slugging percentage — that's 90th percentile power from the shortstop position.

Then 2025 happened. The home runs were cut in half. The slugging dropped 91 points. The ISO fell from .248 to .165. By traditional counting stats, it looked like a regression to the mean — or maybe something worse.

But the 2025 season isn't as simple as "Henderson got worse." Something shifted in how he hit the ball, and it shows up clearly in the batted ball data.

## Where Did the Power Go?

The surface-level explanation is straightforward: Henderson hit fewer home runs because he hit the ball less hard and barreled it less often. But the underlying data tells a more nuanced story.

| Metric | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | Direction |
|--------|------|------|------|-----------|
| Hard Hit% | 39.4% | 43.4% | 39.3% | Down |
| Barrel% | 11.4% | 11.2% | 8.5% | Down |
| Exit Velocity | 92.0 | 92.8 | 92.1 | Flat |
| Launch Angle | 11.4 | 9.2 | 9.5 | Flat |
| GB% | 45.0% | 46.7% | 48.3% | Up |
| FB% | 35.9% | 32.6% | 31.0% | Down |
| Pull% | 39.9% | 39.2% | 37.8% | Down |

<!-- visualization: player-stats, {"playerId": "hendegu01", "metrics": ["hard_pct", "barrel_pct", "gb_pct"], "title": "Henderson Batted Ball Profile"} -->

A few things stand out:

**Exit velocity held steady.** Henderson's average EV stayed in the 92 mph range across all three full seasons. He didn't lose bat speed or raw power. The ball was coming off the bat at the same velocity — it just wasn't going to the same places.

**Barrel rate dropped meaningfully.** From 11.2% in 2024 to 8.5% in 2025 — that's a 24% decline in the rate at which he hit the ball at the optimal combination of exit velocity and launch angle. Barrels are the batted balls that produce the most damage, and Henderson produced significantly fewer of them.

**Ground ball rate crept up while fly ball rate fell.** Henderson went from a 45/36 GB/FB split in 2023 to 48/31 in 2025. More balls on the ground means fewer chances for the ball to leave the yard, even when exit velocity stays the same.

**He pulled the ball less.** Pull% dropped from 39.9% in 2023 to 37.8% in 2025. For a left-handed hitter at Camden Yards, pulling the ball is where the home runs live. Going the other way more often generates more hits but fewer extra-base hits.

The composite picture: Henderson maintained his raw bat speed but changed his approach — intentionally or not — in ways that traded power for contact. His BABIP of .329 in 2025 was the highest of his career, suggesting more balls in play were falling in. But the balls that fell in were singles, not home runs.

## The Discipline Story Is All Good

While the power took a step back, Henderson's plate discipline continued an unbroken trend in the right direction. His strikeout rate has declined every single year of his career:

| Season | K% | BB% |
|--------|-----|-----|
| 2022 | 25.8% | 12.1% |
| 2023 | 25.6% | 9.0% |
| 2024 | 22.1% | 10.8% |
| 2025 | 21.0% | 9.5% |

Going from a 25.8% strikeout rate as a 21-year-old to 21.0% at age 24 is meaningful development. He's making more contact, putting more balls in play, and generally becoming harder to strike out. At 21% in 2025, he was already better than the league average (22.4%).

The walk rate has fluctuated more — the 12.1% in his 34-game debut is a small sample, and the full-season rates have bounced between 9% and 11%. There's room for the walk rate to stabilize at the higher end of that range as he matures. A 21-year-old shortstop who doesn't strike out much and draws a reasonable number of walks is a foundation you can build a franchise around.

## The Speed Dimension

Here's a part of Henderson's game that doesn't get enough attention: he has become a genuinely elite baserunner.

| Season | SB | Spd | BsR |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|
| 2022 | 1 | 3.3 | -0.3 |
| 2023 | 10 | 6.9 | +5.8 |
| 2024 | 21 | 6.7 | +4.0 |
| 2025 | 30 | 6.5 | +7.3 |

<!-- visualization: player-stats, {"playerId": "hendegu01", "metrics": ["sb", "bsr"], "title": "Henderson Speed & Baserunning"} -->

30 stolen bases in 2025, up from 21 the year before. His BsR (baserunning runs above average) of +7.3 was the best mark of his career. For a 6'3" shortstop, this kind of speed-plus-instincts combination is unusual.

The stolen base progression — 1, 10, 21, 30 — suggests he's still learning how to use his speed at the major league level. If Henderson reaches the 30/30 club (30 HR, 30 SB) in a single season, he'd become one of a handful of shortstops in history to do it. In 2024, he came close with 37/21. In 2025, it was 17/30 — the power and speed traded places.

The 2026 projection question is whether he can do both at once.

## What 6.0 Projected fWAR Means

The projection systems (ZiPS, Steamer) converge on approximately 6.0 fWAR for Henderson in 2026. Here's what that implies and what it doesn't.

**What it implies:** Henderson is projected as a top-15 position player in baseball. The 6.0 figure splits the difference between his 7.9 WAR peak (2024) and his 4.8 WAR season (2025). The projections are essentially saying: expect the power to bounce back partially but not fully, expect the speed to hold, expect continued plate discipline improvement, and expect solid shortstop defense.

**What it doesn't capture:** Projections are median outcomes. They smooth out the extremes. Henderson's actual outcome range is probably something like 4.0 to 8.5 WAR, depending on whether the power comes back. A 4.0 WAR Henderson is a good regular. An 8.5 WAR Henderson is an MVP candidate. The projection splits the difference, but the Orioles' 2026 ceiling depends heavily on which end of that range he lands on.

**The age factor:** Henderson turns 25 during the 2026 season. Historically, hitters tend to reach peak performance between ages 25-29, with many power hitters peaking around 26-27. If Henderson follows historical aging curves, 2026 and 2027 could be his best seasons. The 2024 campaign at age 23 might not have been the peak — it might have been the preview.

## The Orioles Context

Henderson doesn't exist in a vacuum. The Orioles added 9.4 net projected fWAR this offseason — the most of any team in baseball — headlined by Pete Alonso (3.6 fWAR), Taylor Ward (2.7), Chris Bassitt (1.9), and Shane Baz (1.8). The lineup around Henderson is meaningfully better than it was in 2025.

That matters for Henderson's individual numbers in two ways. First, better lineup protection means pitchers can't pitch around him as easily. If Alonso is hitting behind him, Henderson will see more strikes. Second, more baserunners ahead of him means more RBI opportunities — though RBI is a team-dependent stat that doesn't tell you much about individual quality.

The bigger picture: the Orioles are clearly in their competitive window. Henderson, Adley Rutschman, and Kyle Bradish form a core of pre-arbitration and arbitration-eligible talent that gives Baltimore a significant cost advantage. The offseason additions signal that the front office is pushing chips in now, while the window is wide open.

Henderson is the most important player on the most improved team in the American League. Whether he's a 5 WAR player or an 8 WAR player in 2026 might be the difference between a wild card berth and a division title.

## The Bottom Line

The projection says 6.0 fWAR. Here's what I'm watching for to tell us early whether Henderson is tracking toward the high end or low end of his range:

**Barrel rate in April-May.** If Henderson is back above 10% in barrels by Memorial Day, the power is coming back. If he's still below 9%, we're looking at a repeat of 2025.

**Ground ball rate.** Below 45% is the sweet spot for Henderson. The more fly balls he hits, the more his raw power translates to game power.

**Stolen base attempts.** If he's running at the same rate as 2025, it means the team is comfortable with his speed-first approach. If the attempts decline, it might signal a mechanical adjustment to get the power back.

Henderson is 24 years old, entering his prime, with 18.2 career WAR already banked. He's gotten steadily better at not striking out every year of his professional career. He has legitimate 30/30 upside. And he plays shortstop.

The projection systems think he'll be one of the 15 best position players in baseball in 2026. Given that he was the 5th best just two years ago, that might be conservative.
